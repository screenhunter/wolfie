# After Event Emitter

```
npm install after-events
```

Publisher/Subscriber Pattern implementation.

## Differences from Node's EventEmitter

*  .then(cb) method (see below)
*  Listeners that throw errors are caught and logged to console.
*  Listeners happen during their own turn.
*  Listener can only listen a maximum of one time with .on()
*  "removeListener" is called "off"
*  No way to see if the listener is listening.  (unused)
*  No "addListener" alias
*  No domains                                   (unused)
*  No erroring on unhandled error event.        (unused)
*  No maximum listener count.                   (unused)
*  No prototype/No `new` needed to create.

### after(callback: function (err: Error U undefined, res: Any U undefined, type: String, ...args: Any)): undefined

* callback is ran after every listener returns.
* First parameter to the callback is the error/rejected value of the listener, if there is one.
* Second parameter to the callback is the return value of the listener, if there is one.
* The rest of the parameters are the parameters sent to the .emit() that triggered the listener.
